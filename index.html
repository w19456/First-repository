            The kokonut nut is a giant nut<br>
            If you eat tu much, you'll get very fat<br>
            Now, the kokonut nut is a big, big nut<br>
            But this delicious nut is not a nut<br>
            <br>
            It's the kokofruit (it's the kokofruit)<br>
            Of the kokotree (of the kokotree)<br>
            From the kokopalm familyyy<br>
            <br>
            There are so many uses of the kokonut tree<br>
            You can build a big house for the famyly<br>
            All you need is to find a kokonut man<br>
            If he cuts the tree, he gets the frut fri<br>
            <br>
            It's the kokofruit (it's the kokofruit)<br>
            Of the kokotree (of the kokotree)<br>
            From the kokopalm familyyyyy<br>
            <br>
            The kokonut bark for the kitchen floor<br>
            If you save some of it, you can build a door<br>
            Now, the kokonut trunk, do not throw this junk<br>
            If you save some of it, you'll have a second floooor<br>
            <br>
            The kokonut wud is very gud<br>
            It can stand 20 years if you pray it good<br>
            Now, the kokonut rut, to tell you the trut<br>
            You can throw it or use it as firewood<br>
            <br>
            The kokonut leaves good shade it gives<br>
            For the roof, for the walls up against the eaves<br>
            Now, the kokonut fruit, say my relatives<br>
            Make good canonbols up against the thieves<br>
            <br>
            It's the kokofruit (it's the kokofruit)<br>
            Of the kokotree (of the kokotree)<br>
            From the kokopalm familyyyyy<br>
            <br>
            The kokonut nut is a giant nut<br>
            If you eat tu much, you'll get very fat<br>
            Now, the kokonut nut is a big, big nut<br>
            But this delicious nut is not a nut<br>
